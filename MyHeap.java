  /*

  //We discussed these 2 methods already:
  private static void pushDown(int[]data,int size,int index)
     - size  is the number of elements in the data array.
     - push the element at index i downward into the correct position. This will swap with the larger of the child nodes provided thatchild is larger. This stops when a leaf is reached, or neither child is larger. [ should be O(logn) ]
     - precondition: index is between 0 and size-1 inclusive
     - precondition: size is between 0 and data.length-1 inclusive.

  private static void pushUp(int[]data,int index)
     - push the element at index i up into the correct position. This will swap it with the parent node until the parent node is larger or the root is reached. [ should be O(logn) ]
     - precondition: index is between 0 and data.length-1 inclusive.

  //We will discuss this today:
  public static void heapify(int[])
    - convert the array into a valid heap. [ should be O(n) ]

  public static void heapsort(int[])
    - sort the array [ should be O(nlogn) ] :
    - converting it into a heap
    - removing the largest value n-1 times (remove places at end of the sub-array).
